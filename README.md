# MANGO-MEDIA

## Project Intent & Functionality
### Intent
This project is created so I can further develop my web development skills.  
By using frameworks like React, Mongooese, Express and more. It is a great  
learning experience, because it gives me the opportunity to architect and  
then encode the envisioned feature.
